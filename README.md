# **Qualitative Analysis with an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System**  

## **üìñ Project Description**  

Manual qualitative data analysis is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, often compromising **validity, replicability, and efficiency**. This project introduces an **LLM-based multi-agent system** designed to **automate qualitative data analysis** while allowing human-AI collaboration.  

Key objectives of the system:  

- Automating **text summarization, code generation, and theme extraction**.
- Enhancing **efficiency** in qualitative research workflows.  
- Providing a **scalable and adaptable** system for researchers and practitioners.  

This system integrates **27 LLM-based multi-agents** to support various qualitative data analysis techniques, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites**  

Before using the system, ensure you have:  
‚úÖ Python **3.8+** installed  
‚úÖ A valid **OpenAI API key**  
‚úÖ Required dependencies installed  


### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Integrating the OpenAI API Key**  

To enable the system, you must configure the OpenAI API key. Choose one of the following methods:  

#### **Set API Key as an Environment Variable**  
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

#### **Modify `app.py`**  
Open `app.py` and manually enter your API key:  
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the System**  

Once configured, execute the program:  

```bash
python app.py
```

The system will perform:  
‚úÖ **Text Summarization**  
‚úÖ **Initial Code Generation**  
‚úÖ **Theme Extraction**
